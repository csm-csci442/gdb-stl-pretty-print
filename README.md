# GDB Pretty-Printing for STL Library

The gdb_pretty_print.sh script should install pretty-printing for several C++
standard template library (STL) containers, including std::string and
std::vector.

## Installing

Run the following command on a Linux computer (e.g. Alamode machines):

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/csm-csci442/gdb-stl-pretty-print/master/gdb_pretty_print.sh | bash
```

Of course, before blindly piping URLs to bash, it's a good idea to look at what
the script actually does.

Just saying... =)
